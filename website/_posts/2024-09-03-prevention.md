excerpt: "At 3Mór, we’re addressing a specific gap or chasm—the missing slice of data that keeps Security and DevOps teams in conflict. It’s not about Shifting Left; it’s about being Better Together. Shifting Left can be contentious. It requires numerous tools and scaffolding for a smooth transition. We believe there’s a better way."

I started watching the series *New Amsterdam*. Initially, I thought it might be inspirational. It’s about a public hospital in NYC. If you haven’t watched it and plan to, I won’t spoil anything. I just started season 2, and the inspiration is flowing. The series takes a more socially conscious approach to problems.

That aspect is timely as I’m working on the 3Mór one-minute pitch for the accelerator program. At a previous company, we aimed to create a world of visibility for our DevOps teams to help them respond to incidents and make better choices. In that sense, we were an IDP moving towards incident response.

## Prevention to save a Million

Recently, [Incident.io](http://Incident.io) announced they are [combining incident response with context](https://incident.io/blog/a-new-era-for-catalog). I’m curious to see where that goes. This problem is crucial. It will be interesting to see how IDPs develop in the coming years compared to incident response tools.

Back to *New Amsterdam*. One thing I love is the show’s ability to highlight systemic issues and find creative solutions. They don’t always work—it is a drama, so there are heartfelt failures. But they strive to solve real systemic problems, and I feel like DevOps is doing the same right now. All these great tools approach issues with the philosophy that an ounce of prevention is worth a million. The reality is, incidents can cost [mid-sized companies up to $1M per year](https://devops.com/real-cost-downtime/).

That’s what I appreciate about the Next Wave of DevOps. We’re acknowledging that we’ve YOLO’d it, but now it’s time to prioritize prevention. DevOps, Platform Eng, and SREs have been doing this through SLOs and SLIs. We have tools targeting infrastructure, code, and security prevention. We need tools that tune and correct the gaps because those gaps are more like chasms that can’t be ignored.

## Fixing the information gap

At 3Mór, we’re addressing a specific gap or chasm—the missing slice of data that keeps Security and DevOps teams in conflict. It’s not about Shifting Left; it’s about being Better Together. Shifting Left can be contentious. It requires numerous tools and scaffolding for a smooth transition. We believe there’s a better way.

3Mór is at the convergence of Security and DevOps teams. What data do both teams need to communicate and appropriately prioritize work? The time is now for a single tool with Security data formatted for DevOps teams to assess risk. We’re calling it Context Driven Prioritization Management (CDPM). It allows teams to mitigate unplanned work, reduce future risk, and respond more efficiently when a zero-day vulnerability emerges.
