We’ve spent the last three years (across two startups!) working on tools to help teams understand their stack, mitigate risks, and create effective guardrails. The rise of AI code tools creates new challenges. We realized that there’s a real need to teach people how these tools work, their strengths and gaps, and how AI fits into the overall software development lifecycle. Whether you’re an enthusiast or a hater, AI is transforming the technology industry and the way we get things done.

In this next phase for 3Mór, our focus is on helping people cultivate curiosity about how AI tools can work for them. For enthusiasts, we know that AI gives you a visual and interactive process for creating apps you’re excited about, but getting past the initial build can be rough. At the same time, experienced programmers need support to integrate AI into their work in a way that doesn’t erase hard-earned knowledge and best practices. Our team has extensive experience on both ends of that spectrum.

Our initial offerings will be focused on workshops, coaching, and development services. We’ll have a pair of intro courses, one for AI builders and one for programmers. We’re also doing one-on-one coaching to help people get unstuck fast and take the next step toward their goals. For those of you who just need someone to take that 70% done project and get it ready to ship, our team can finish developing it for you.

It’s important to us that we meet people where they are in their journey and not sideline anyone for their concerns or having different skills or a less technical background. We want to take the enthusiasm that’s out there and help you build the guardrails that are needed for these tools to provide the best result. We’ve seen how much frustration, disappointment, and conflict can happen when we get it wrong.

Thank you to everyone who’s supported 3Mór over this past year. Your encouragement and honest feedback has been so important for us. We’re excited about this next part of our journey, and we hope you’ll stay with us as we continue our work. [Sign up for the mailing list](https://buttondown.com/3mor) so we can keep in touch.
