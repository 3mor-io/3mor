title: "Beyond Shift Left: Transforming Security from Reactive to Proactive Teamwork"
excerpt: "The holiday season should be a time of joy, not security anxiety. But in 2024, the numbers are dire: CVEs have increased 30% year over year, with ransomware attacks like Blue Yonder becoming so commonplace that they barely register as news. This isn't just a trend—it's a wake-up call. Just because cyber attacks have become our 'new normal' doesn't mean we should accept them as inevitable."

The holiday season should be a time of joy, not security anxiety. But in 2024, the numbers are dire: [CVEs have increased 30%](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366600424/2024-seeing-more-CVEs-than-ever-before-but-few-are-weaponised) year over year, with ransomware attacks like [Blue Yonder](https://www.scworld.com/news/ransomware-attack-on-blue-yonder-disrupts-retailers-ahead-of-holidays) becoming so commonplace that they barely register as news. This isn't just a trend—it's a wake-up call. Just because cyber attacks have become our "new normal" doesn't mean we should accept them as inevitable.

## The Overwhelming Reality of Vulnerability Management
Picture this: Another spreadsheet lands in your inbox. Your stress levels spike. You're faced with a daunting list of vulnerabilities, each entry demanding your attention while your existing workload continues to pile up. But does this spreadsheet actually tell you what you need to know?

- Does it provide a dependency graph for a quick threat model?
- Can you quickly distinguish between a true critical vulnerability and noise?
- Are you left navigating a maze of technical complexities with limited resources?

The truth is, Ops teams are often stuck proving whether a CVE is critical or not. They are overwhelmed and left without the tools to address the current system's complexity with or without the stress of vulnerability management and security best practices. 

## What happens when you fall behind?
Many teams rely on tools like Dependabot, which are incredibly helpful unless you get behind on mitigating technical debt. [Computer Weekly](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366600424/2024-seeing-more-CVEs-than-ever-before-but-few-are-weaponised) writes about the reality of technical debt and version management and the situation is far more nuanced:

> "The increase in CVEs reflects rising software complexity and the broader use of technology, necessitating advanced and dynamic vulnerability management strategies to mitigate evolving cyber security threats," -Saeed Abassi, Qualys

Some version bumps require more than automated updates. They demand insight, strategic planning, and a deep understanding of your technology ecosystem. Which is even more lift and pressure on our Ops teams.

## The Silent Threat: Ransomware and cyberattacks
There's a growing, insidious trend that's flying under the radar: [strategic cyber attacks](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/thanksgiving-us-risk-cyberattack/734049/) that exploit organizational vulnerabilities. These aren't random strikes—they're calculated:

- Attacks frequently occur during high-stress periods
- Timing is chosen deliberately: before holidays, after workforce reductions
- Targeted when organizations are understaffed 

The consequences are profound: disrupted payroll, supply chain challenges, and critical systems brought to a standstill for the holiday. This is a systemic problem that will not solve itself and our current methods of remediation are not sufficient.

## Beyond "Shifting Left": A Holistic Approach to Security
We've reached a critical inflection point. System complexity has outpaced our management capabilities. The question isn't whether you're at your breaking point, it's how close you are.
**Your Imperative: Proactive Security Investment**
It's time to invest in tooling that doesn't just find vulnerabilities but actively remediates weaknesses:

- Identify abandoned repositories
- Detect vulnerable artifacts
- Audit and implement robust CD pipeline policies

Whether you're a DevOps, Platform Engineering, or GitOps team, security must be baked in.
