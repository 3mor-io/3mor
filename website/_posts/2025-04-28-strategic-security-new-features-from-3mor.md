## Why Strategy Matters in Security

At 3Mór, we're guided by our namesake, the Mórrigan—goddess of strategy. Our mission is simple: to help you be strategic about security in the midst of complex technical stacks and objectives.

We've investigated why teams delay implementing Dependabot fixes or addressing CVEs. Beyond the overwhelming volume of alerts, we discovered something surprising: insufficient CI/CD infrastructure is often the biggest blocker.

## The CI/CD Challenge

Many teams struggle with perfectionism when building testing frameworks. The vast literature on best practices can paralyze action—we overthink, over-discuss, and wait for perfection. This often leads to delayed implementation or over-engineered solutions. In a nutshell, perfect is the enemy of good.

During my time at Puppet implementing DevOps practices, we learned a valuable lesson: start by fixing one small repeatable problem. Automate that. Save time. Then build from there. 

## Our Solution: Order of Operations

In the coming weeks, we're rolling out "order of operations" recommendations to simplify your security journey. When you visit our Actions page for a repository, you'll see:

* Tailored prompts for implementing security measures  
* Step-by-step implementation guides  
* Verification checklists for prompt engineering  
* Our recommended "happy path" with guardrails against AI hallucinations

## Connecting Security and CI/CD

This approach directly strengthens your vulnerability management by:

1. Reducing your attack surface  
2. Fortifying existing systems  
3. Making major version upgrades manageable, not herculean

For vulnerabilities requiring major version bumps, we'll assess your CI/CD readiness and provide recommendations for necessary tests and linting—complete with prompts, checklists, and implementation paths.

Even when you're not facing urgent patches like Log4j, we'll guide you through strengthening your CI/CD pipeline—a critical security measure given that these pipelines are frequent targets for hackers, ransomware groups, and nation-states.

## Join Our Early Testers

We're seeking early testers for these features. [Sign up](https://portal.app.3mor.io/) for our 90-day free trial to experience the value firsthand. After the trial, individual and small team pricing is $20/user per month, with special considerations for non-profits, schools, and government agencies.
