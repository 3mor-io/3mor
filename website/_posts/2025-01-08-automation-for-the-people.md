I was catching up on the SREcon EMEA talks and Courtney Nash‚Äôs [Exploring the unintended consequences of automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkhJ_bcIy4) dives into why automation doesn‚Äôt always do what we think it‚Äôs going to do. Automation creates more complexity. More automation means we need more infrastructure to make sure the automation is automating correctly. Hello drift! This requires a person to understand when things have gone off course.

The [slides that are most relevant](https://youtu.be/kkkhJ_bcIy4?t=1322) to this blog are the ones talking about what points a human had to intervene with an incident on behalf of automation. Meaning, automation was the cause of the chaos. Think about that for a minute. We know the cost per minute of incident can be as [high as $9,000/minute](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/04/10/the-true-cost-of-downtime-and-how-to-avoid-it/). [That‚Äôs up from $5,600/min](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2021/06/the-cost-of-cybersecurity-incidents-the-problem/) a few years ago. It‚Äôs clear that since we started automating, using the cloud, and now using GenAI things have been a little [‚Äúhold on to your hats‚Äù](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/learn/cost-of-downtime/). ü§†

After years of managers wondering if they have ‚Äúthe DevOps‚Äù because they bought a tool, we realize through time and data that we do not in fact have the DevOps. ü§Ø This is mostly because we thought a tool or automation was the DevOps when really there is a [symbiotic relationship between people and automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9kWbkc30lM).

3M√≥r is creating tooling that helps your team surface the complexity you are facing and make it actionable. We give you the map, project list, and a few starting points. We are doing the wildly boring work of helping you stair-step your way to a tidier stack. And for those complex bits, we surface the context you need to build more effectively and securely.

We provide the conversation starter for Ops and Security to collaborate on how to address your [vulnerability hell](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/asadeddin_lets-talk-about-vulnerability-hell-and-activity-7217226704602169345-ySwj/). We bring visibility so that your Devs see where they fit into the whole without forcing them to be Ops or Security.
